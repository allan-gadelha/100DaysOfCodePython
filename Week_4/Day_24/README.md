Today we learned how to Open, Read and Write to File using "with" Keyword, understanding Relative and Absolute File Paths.

We did 2 things today, the first was to create a high score for the Snake game from Day 20/21, and also crease a Mail Merge Automation.

It was my first time using directory and saving files, was a little weird at the beginning, i figured out that using relative path on VS Code was harder
i needed to chance a settings, but even when chancing it, still didn't work, so i just used Absolute path instead.
