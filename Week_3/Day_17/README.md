Today we learned more about OOP, how to work with Attributes, Class Constructors, _init_ function and adding Methods to a Class

The project for today was a true-false quiz game using only OOP!

It's been some years since i've made something using OOP, but it was on Java, i never really liked OOP, at the time was really confusing, now i still find it confusing, took me sometime to understand it at all, can't even say that i've got everything, still confusing, but at least now i can see why OOP can be useful.

Definitly need to practice more, for a first project using OOP from scratch, was a nice one!
