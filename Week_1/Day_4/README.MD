In this day we learned about Random Module, IndexError and Nested Lists!

I've put a bonus file on this day because of a exercise before the project of day 4, i had a lot of trouble trying to figure a method.

I could've brute force it using a lot of IF's i've done like that, but i really didn't liked the code was use and boring, so for the first time i watched the teaches videos before "finishing" the exercise and the method was amazing.

It used position[] to get the "A","B" or "C", put it in lower cause so there's no problem if the user put A or a, creating a new list so we could use .index later and also the -1 on the number index, this exercise was really eye opener.

The Project os this day is a Rock, Paper and Scissors game!
