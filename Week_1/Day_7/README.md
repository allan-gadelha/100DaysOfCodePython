Today is the last day of the first week and it's just the final project and i need to use everything i learned on it. The project is a Hangman Game

Part 1: Added the basic loop for choosing the word from a list then getting input from player and checking if the input letter exist in the chosen word

Part 2: Added Display so the player can see the if the choose exist in the chosen word or not

Part 2.1: Changed the way the code gonna loop trought the word.

Part 3: While loop to make the game running till the player gets the word right also conditional to see if the world is right, that probably will need to be changed in the future!
