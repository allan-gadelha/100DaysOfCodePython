This day we learned about Data Types, Type Error, Type Checking, Type Conversion, Mathematical Operations,
Number Manipulation and F String

The project for this day was to create a Tip Calculator, even though we didn't saw If and Elif in the course yet since i already had the knowledge i used it.

Seeing the video for this project later, the method that was used for calculating the tip was indeed more simple than what i did: "tip_as_percent = tip / 100" with that i would get the percentage of the tip and then i would apply it on the bill_value to get the total tip amount: "total_tip_amount = bill_value*tip_as_percent" and finally the "total_bill = bill_value + total_tip_amount"

I've made the code unecessary longer and more complicated than it should be, also i've made the variable's name longer on purpose.
