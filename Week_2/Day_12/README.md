Today we learned about Local vs Global Scope and Python Constants.

The project for this day is to create a "Number Guessing Game"

I didn't use any Global Variable in this code, but i've managed to create something using dictionaries, which was something that i've been wanting to do, still a little rusty with it, but i managed to do it! Also learned a two new ways to failproof the code in case the user input something that invalid for me.
