Today we learned about Functions with Outputs, Multiple return values, Combining Dictionaris and Functions, more about While loops, flags and Recursion.

The project of this day is to make a calculator!

The cool part about this day was learning about dict and saving functions in it, a really nice way to call functions using key from dict, i can see lots of useful ways to use it, but i still need more practice with it, still take me a time to understand and to create it from 0 if it gets too much complex!
